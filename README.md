# Handwritten-number-Identification-using-KNN
This project features an implementation of the KNN (K- Nearest Neighbors) algorithm for classifying handwritten digits. It includes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensionality, enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the KNN classification. The project also focuses on hyperparameter tuning to optimize preformance.
